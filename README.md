# QSS-exercises-python

I’ve been reading Introduction to Quantitave Social Sciences by Kosuke Imai lately. Unfortunately, the solutions to the exercises of the book are only provided to lecturers, and people who study the book individually are not considered. I thought I could put the solutions I could make on github. Also, I’m solving the exercises in Python.

R solutions: https://github.com/takakishi/Textbook-Solution-Code-for-Quantitative-Social-Science-An-Introduction/tree/master

Python code of the book: https://github.com/jeffallen13/qsspy/tree/main

(I benefitted from these sources a lot, thank you guys!!)

Status:
